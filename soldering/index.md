- Brass wool/coil **tip cleaner**
- Small **silicone work mat**
- Leaded solder, **63/37 or 60/40**, ~0.6–0.8 mm
- Basic **helping hands** (optional but nice)
- **Flush cutters**
- **Needle-nose pliers**
- Manual **solder sucker** (spring-loaded)
- **Solder wick** (~2 mm)
- ESD-safe **tweezers** (starter grade)

### Consumables

- **Isopropyl alcohol** (70–99%) + lint-free wipes
- **No-clean flux pen**
- Small **tip tinner** (optional)

### Safety

- USB or budget **fume extractor**
- **Safety glasses**

> Gets someone productive immediately with simple boards and repair without a big cash burn.

## 🟡 Intermediate Soldering Kit (Everyday Maker / Repair Tech)

**Audience:** folks who’ve done a few boards and want cleaner joints, light microsoldering, and reliable daily tooling.

### Core Tools

- Mid-range **soldering station** (Hakko/Quick/KSGER/Pinecil V2-level)
- Swappable tips: **fine conical, chisel, bevel**
- Quality **brass coil** + **tip tinner**
- Larger **silicone work mat** with compartments
- Premium **flush cutters**
- High-quality **ESD tweezers** set
- Precision **side cutters / micro shears**
- Strong **desoldering pump** (with Teflon tip)
- Bench **fume extractor** with carbon filter

### Consumables

- High-quality leaded solder (e.g., **Kester 44** or similar)
- **Rosin flux paste** or pro-grade flux pens
- **Flux remover spray**
- **Low-temp solder paste** (optional)
- Isopropyl alcohol, **99%**
- Solder wick in multiple widths (1.5 / 2.5 / 3.5 mm)

### Add-ons

- **PCB holder / vise**
- **Magnifying lamp** or entry-level **USB microscope**
- **Kapton tape** for localized heat shielding

> This is the “I do this a lot” bench — much nicer ergonomics and rework options.

## Expanding to Other Areas

This same Beginner / Intermediate / Professional pattern can be reused for:

- [ ] Electronics & EE Bench Setup  
- [ ] CAD & 3D Printing Tools  
- [ ] Embedded / Microcontroller Labs  
- [ ] Microsoldering & BGA-Specific Gear  

Each section can live in its own folder (e.g., `/electronics`, `/cad-3d-printing`) using this same structure.
