# Workshop Resources

This site curates starter guides, toolkits, and references for:

- [Soldering & Rework](./soldering/)
- [Electronics & Electrical Engineering](./electronics/)
- [CAD & 3D Printing](./cad-3d-printing/)
- [Computer Engineering & Embedded Systems](./computer-engineering/)
- [Microsoldering & BGA Rework](./microsoldering/)

The goal is to stay **budget-conscious**, **practical**, and **beginner-friendly**, with clear upgrade paths for:

- 🟢 **Beginner** — get started safely and cheaply  
- 🟡 **Intermediate** — everyday maker / repair tech  
- 🔵 **Professional** — lab-grade / rework bench

Over time, we’ll also maintain an inventory of recommended tools and potential affiliate links.
